Hello my name is Kelly! Nice to meet you! I am a new college student (first year) and my major is architecture! I appear shy and quiet at first but once I get to talk to someone I can get more comfortable and I'm friendly! I am also a commuter student I live around 30 minutes away from campus I don't think it's that bad personally. Some random facts about me is that my favorite color is blue and some countries that I would love to visit would be France, England, and Japan. I like listening to music a lot (I listen to a variety of genres such as r&b, pop, rock, indie pop, etc.) but some of my favorite artists/bands are Harry Styles, Kali Uchis, TV Girl, Mitski, and Gorillaz. My favorite food is chicken I eat this food often in many forms whether its cooked in the oven or grilled I love it.
